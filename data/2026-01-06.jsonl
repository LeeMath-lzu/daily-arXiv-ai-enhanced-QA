Using monoidal categorifications due to Hernandez-Leclerc and Nakajima, we establish a cluster-theoretic interpretation of the folding map $φ_{2n}$ of $q$-characters, introduced by Hernandez. To this end, we introduce a notion of foldability for cluster algebras arising from infinite quivers and study a specific case of cluster algebras of type $A_\\infty$. Using this interpretation of $φ_{2n}$, we prove a conjecture of Hernandez in new cases. Finally, we study a particular simple $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_{2n,\\mathrm{tor}})$-module whose $q$-character is not a cluster variable, and conjecture that it is imaginary."}

A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$."}

Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025.

A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94].\n  A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the mutations of coefficients. In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra.\n  We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichmüller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation. The irreducible intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07], and we give a partial evidence."}

It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.\n  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers."}
