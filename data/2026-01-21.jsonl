This isomorphism maps the derived Hall basis (the natural basis of the derived Hall algebra) to a class of double Hall-Littlewood (HL) symmetric functions, which are formulated via raising and lowering operators. These double HL functions are parameterized by bipartitions; they reduce to the classical HL functions when one of the partitions is empty, and specialize to Schur Laurent symmetric functions at $t = 0$. We also derive the Pieri rules for these double HL functions. Additionally, we obtain several natural generating functions for the derived Hall algebra as well as their transition relations, which can be transferred to the ring of double symmetric functions via the established ring isomorphism."}

Its robustness against local noise is rooted in the structure of its topological excitations. From the perspective of quantum phases of matter, it is essential to understand these excitations in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we analyze the color code model on an infinite lattice within the quasi-local $C^{*}$-algebra framework, using a cone-localized Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) analysis. We classify its irreducible anyon superselection sectors and construct explicit string operators that generate anyonic excitations from the ground state. We further examine the fusion and braiding properties of these excitations. Our results show that the topological order of the color code is described by $\\mathsf{Rep}(D(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)) \\simeq \\mathsf{Rep}(D(\\mathbb{Z}_2)) \\boxtimes \\mathsf{Rep}(D(\\mathbb{Z}_2))$, which is equivalent to a double layer of the toric code and consistent with established analyses on finite lattices."}

This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\\mathfrak{Q}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed."}

The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fréchet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.\n  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.\n  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction."}
