Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups. We prove this upper bound conjecture for Kazhdan-Patterson coverings of general linear groups."}

Our approach is similar in spirit to the work of Goussarov, Polyak, and Viro expressing finite-type invariants of classical knots in terms of Gauss diagrams. We similarly project higher dimensional knots and links onto a hyperplane and study the preimages of the sets of double and singular points in the embedded spheres. As an auxiliary result, we show that the space of $n$-dimensional braids with $k$ strands in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+q}$ is a homotopy retract of the space of long links $\\underset{k}{\\sqcup}\\mathbb{R}^n\\hookrightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{n+q}$ for $q\\geq 3$, thus proving a conjecture of Komendarczyk, Koytcheff and Volić."}

Sections 3 and 4 have been merged, the main theorem of this sections has been refined, and its proof simplified. In addition, the results concerning representations of types B_\\ell, C_\\ell, and D_\\ell have been substantially modified, improving the precision regarding the primes p (the characteristics) for which our results hold", "summary": "Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p>2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses."}

Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones are of such a form. We also show that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which armatively answers a question by Early in \\cite{E1}. Plabic graphs, invented by Postnikov \\cite{P}, are of use in proving this result. As a corollary, we get that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separatedcollections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian."}
