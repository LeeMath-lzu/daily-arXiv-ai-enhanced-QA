Comments welcomed", "summary": "We prove that the unitary Drinfeld center of a unitary tensor category is equivalente to the category of unitary bimodules for the canonical W*-algebra object, generalizing Müger's result to the non-fusion case. This is then used to express factorization homology in terms of C*-algebraic extensions of symmetric enveloping algebras and actions of Drinfeld dobules of compact quantum groups."}

Motivated by a toy model for quantum gravity to replace integration over metrics by integration over Dirac operators, we give an overview of multitrace and multimatrix random matrix models built from spectral triples and analyze them in the large $N$ limit using positivity constraints on Hankel moment matrices. In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly.\n  We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings."}

We provide a precise characterization of the ideals of semidirect products and describe the structure of their prime spectrum. Furthermore, we introduce a family of finite simple L-algebras and prove that every simple linear L-algebra belongs to this family. We also show that the family we construct coincides with the class of simple algebras in a certain subclass of finite CKL-algebras. As an application, we use these results to give a clear description of linear Hilbert algebras and their symmetric semidirect products."}

Hajac", "Tomasz Maszczyk", "Bartosz Zieliński"], "title": "Milnor meets Hopf and Toeplitz at the K-theory of quantum projective planes", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "We explore applications of the celebrated construction of the Milnor connecting homomorphism from the odd to the even K-groups in the context of Hopf--Galois theory. For a finitely generated projective module associated to any piecewise cleft principal comodule algebra, we provide an explicit formula computing the clutching $K_1$-class in terms of the representation matrix defining the module. Thus, the module is determined by an explicit Milnor idempotent. We apply this new tool to the K-theory of quantum complex projective planes to determine their $K_0$-generators in terms of modules associated to noncommutative Hopf fibrations. On the other hand, using explicit homotopy between unitaries, we express the $K_0$-class of the Milnor idempotents in terms of elementary projections in the Toeplitz C*-algebra. This allows us to infer that all our generators are in the positive cone of the $K_0$-group, which is a purely quantum phenomenon absent in the classical case."}

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems."}
