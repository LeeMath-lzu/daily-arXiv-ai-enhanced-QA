Firstly, we prove that finite solutions correspond to Hopf algebras with the positive basis property. As a corollary we generalise Lu-Yan-Zhu classification to arbitrary characteristic $0$ fields $k$. Secondly, we study the general problem of when a Hopf algebra has a basis yielding a set-theoretic solution. Finally, we classify all (co)commutative bijective solutions. This result requires to obtain a description of all bases of a group algebra $k[G]$ yielding a set-theoretic solution. We namely show that such bases correspond, through a Fourier transform, to splittings $A \\rtimes N$ of $G$ with $A$ a finite abelian group."}

In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.\n  The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.\n  In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.\n  As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity."}

This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case.\n  The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level."}

Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models."}

The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\\mathbb{Z}_{N\\times \\gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\\mathbb{Z}_{N\\times \\gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process."}

These include, for example, superalgebras, $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, and a topological space $X$. We construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the structure sheaf takes values in the $G$-graded variety $\\mathbf{G\\text{-}var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$. This provides a framework that classifies geometric spaces whose local models belong to $\\mathbf{G\\text{-}var}(A)$. We study conditions under which two such geometries can be compared in a (graded) Morita context, as well as the compatibility of their corresponding differential calculi. As an application, we prove a Morita-equivariant Betti/Riemann--Hilbert theorem: varying the coefficients along the Morita $(2,1)$-groupoid, the fixed-coefficient equivalences are compatible with transport and hence induce a biequivalence of Grothendieck totals."}
