Based on Letzter's triangular decomposition we define Verma modules. Using magical operators that are compatible with weight spaces, we classify weight Verma modules and characterise their irreducible finite dimensional quotients. We then prove the existence of weight bases in tensor products by explicitly constructing some highest weight vectors. These constructions allow us to mimic the important aspects of the classical finite dimensional representation theory. Applications include a definition of rational representations, the BGG resolution, a Clebsch--Gordan formula, the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and central characters, as well as a classification and description of all irreducible polynomial representations."}

Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \\times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\\mathcal X_{|\\mathcal A_n|}$.\n  V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $φ_n$ from the Teichmüller space $\\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \\in \\{1,2\\}$ boundary components into $\\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\\text{Im}(φ_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\\text{Im}(φ_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\\text{rank}(A+A^T) \\le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$."}

We elevate both approaches to the level of bialgebras and prove that the Lie bialgebraa obtained using these two approaches are the same. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the dendriform Yang-Baxter equation in dendriform algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the Lie algebras induced from the dendriform algebras.

This may be seen as a generalization of symmetrization trick from [1], but for the generally non-symmetric BAF. We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1]."}

For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior.

In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles."}

We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter.

We develop a radically new approach whose main innovative features are 1.) a structural implementation of the additivity property used in earlier approaches and 2.) a reduction of the global equivalence problem to a family of simpler spacetime-wise problems. When applied to the case where the target category is a symmetric monoidal $1$-category, this yields a generalization of the equivalence theorem from [Commun. Math. Phys. 377, 971 (2019)]. In the case where the target is the symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category of cochain complexes, we obtain a reduction of the global $\\infty$-categorical equivalence problem to simpler, but still challenging, spacetime-wise problems. The latter would be solved by showing that certain functors between $1$-categories exhibit $\\infty$-localizations, however the available detection criteria are inconclusive in our case."}
