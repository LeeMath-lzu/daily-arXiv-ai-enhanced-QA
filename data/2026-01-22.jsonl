As an application, we recover and extend conditions under which modules over Hopf monads and Hopf algebroids inherit Grothendieck-Verdier structures. We also characterize when categories of bimodules, modules, and local modules over (commutative) algebras internal to a Grothendieck-Verdier category admit such structures. Our results apply to quantales, smash product algebras, skew group algebras, and enveloping algebras of Lie-Rinehart algebras.\n  For applications of the lifting theorem, we construct a strict $2$-equivalence between a $2$-category of Grothendieck-Verdier categories and one of linearly distributive categories with negation, and extend this $2$-equivalence to the braided setting."}

The inequality implies a necessary condition for a quadruple of graphs to be realized as inclusion graphs of a commuting square of multi-matrix algebras. As a corollary, we obtain a unitary categorification criterion for based rings, in particular, fusion rings."}

This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\\mathfrak{Q}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed."}

Changed title, added to Thm. 1.1, reorganized sections, and added Sections 10-13", "summary": "We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct functors assigning left and right Leibniz algebras to affine algebraic racks. These functors are compatible with closed subracks and ideals, and they recover the Lie algebras of linear algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks. We also study properties of coordinate algebras and Leibniz algebras of affine algebraic racks. Finally, we use rack schemes to functorially construct (co-)nondegenerate Yang-Baxter operators in various categories."}
