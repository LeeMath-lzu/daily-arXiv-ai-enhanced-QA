We also observe that the function $Λ(θ)$ is the boundary value of an Eichler integral of a level $2$ modular form of weight $4$, and use this to propose a conjectural transformation law for the signature function in genus 2 similar to the reciprocity formula for classical Dedekind sums."}

While these structures capture the cubic sector, they fail to encode higher-valence phenomena, for which a homotopy-theoretic extension becomes necessary. This work introduces a conceptual notion of homotopy coexact BV-algebra, defined through the homotopical interplay of commutative and BV structures, and provides a concrete model in terms of generators and relations, obtained through an extension the theory of Koszul duality for operads. The resulting framework enables the systematic use of homotopical tools -- $\\infty$-morphisms, homotopy transfer, rectification, and deformation theory -- and naturally accommodates the quartic-level structures recently identified in Yang--Mills theory."}

Shortly after, they were defined and studied intrinsically by Effros and Ruan, and by this author. In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.\n  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.\n  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory. On the other hand however, we have tried to make these notes highly self-contained. The aim of these notes in the first place is not to give new results but rather to review known results in a more modern perspective, taking into account recent developments. We believe this may be helpful for people who want to work with compact and discrete quantum groups now."}

We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\\cA}) = \\FF[\\sinh(\\pm x^{p} \\sinh(t))]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\\Br(\\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative hyperbolic sine algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity."}

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider \"all-boson type\" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples."}

As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria.
