We show that the contravariant functor ${ }^{0}$ is right adjoint to the contravariant functor ${ }^{*c}$. We define the Loc functor from the category of differential Lie coalgebras to the category of locally finite differential Lie coalgebras, associating to any differential Lie coalgebra $M$ the differential Lie coalgebra Loc$(M)$, defined as the largest locally finite differential Lie subcoalgebra of $M$. We prove that for any Lie conformal algebra $L$ that is free as a $\\mathbb{C}[\\partial]$-module, Loc$(L^{0})$ is the set of conformal linear maps on $L$ whose kernel contains an ideal of $L$ of cofinite rank.

Their 3-tensors satisfying the ``zipper condition'' play an important role there. We identify their 4-tensors with bi-unitary connections in Jones' subfactor theory in operator algebras with precise normalization constants. Then we prove that their tensors satisfying the zipper condition are the same as flat fields of strings in subfactor theory which correspond to elements in the higher relative commutants of the subfactor arising from the bi-unitary connection. This is what we expect, since the zipper condition is a kind of pentagon relations, but we clarify what conditions are exactly needed for this -- we do not need the flatness or the finite depth condition for the bi-unitary connection. We actually generalize their 4-tensors so that the four index sets of the 4-tensors can be all different and work on a ``half-version'' of the zipper condition."}
