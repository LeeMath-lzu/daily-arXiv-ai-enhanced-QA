Comments and suggestions welcome!", "summary": "We give an invariant construction of reduced HOMFLY homology for arbitrary links reduced at components of arbitrary color and prove some structural properties relating this invariant to unreduced HOMFLY homology. Combined with previous results, this gives a recursive formula for the reduced HOMFLY homology of colored positive torus knots and some colored positive torus links. We prove that after forgetting the quantum grading, the resulting doubly-graded invariant of positive torus knots grows exactly exponentially in the color, resolving a 2013 conjecture of Gorsky--Gukov--Stošić. Finally, we verify the ``color-shifting\" conjecture of Gukov--Nawata--Saberi--Stošić--Sułkowski in many examples."}

In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."}

As an application, we classify quantum symmetries of the set of two points and the algebra of dual numbers. In addition, we show that the straight line does not admit an (ungraded) universal coacting Manin Hopf algebra. Moreover, we prove that for $n\\geqslant 14$ the full matrix algebra $M_n(\\mathbb k)$ admits a nontrivial Hopf algebra coaction such that all Hopf algebra actions with the same restriction on the cosupport are trivial, i.e. the cosupport may reduce under the dualization and a finite dimensional algebra may have less equivalence classes of actions than coactions. Simultaneously, for any $n\\geqslant 14$, we define an elementary grading on $M_n(\\mathbb k)$ by an infinite group that cannot be regraded by any finite group.

Xu. Whereas the latter applied the construction to the algebra of differential operators on a classical base $B$, we show that the dual of this is the algebra of sections $J(B)$ of the jet bundle and hence that the latter forms a Hopf algebroid. This is constructed for commutative algebras $B$ in a pro-object setting via quotients of the pair Hopf algebroid $B\\otimes B$ and can then be deformed by our cotwist construction to give a possibly noncommutative jet Hopf algebroid over a noncommutative base. We also observe in the commutative case that $J^k(B)$ for jets of order $k$ can be identified with $J^1(B_k)$ where $B_k$ denotes $B$ equipped with a certain noncommutative first order differential calculus."}

When the underlying simple Lie algebra is of exceptional type, such a formula remains conjectural in many cases. Using a linear recurrence relation satisfied by the characters of KR modules, we convert the verification of a polyhedral formula into an identity between two rational functions of a single variable with only simple poles at known locations. It is then sufficient to compare the residues at those poles, which are explicitly computable quantities. By applying this strategy, we obtain new, computer-assisted and easily verifiable proofs of known polyhedral formulas in types $F_4$ and $G_2$ within a uniform framework."}
