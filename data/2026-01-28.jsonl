In the case of $t=q^{-m}$ with natural $m$, eigenfunctions of the first system of Hamiltonians are the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAFs) introduced by O. Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly."}

In this note, we show that the knot invariant produced by any XC-structure on the Sweedler algebra is completely determined by the framing of the knot. Furthermore, we also exhibit explicit families of XC-structures on the Sweedler algebra that do not have a ribbon Hopf-algebraic origin."}

In this paper, generalizing the approach of De Concini-Kac-Procesi for quantum groups, we study the structures and irreducible representations of the iquantum group $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$.\n  We establish a Frobenius center of $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$ as a coideal subalgebra of the Frobenius center of the quantum group $\\mathrm{U}_v$. Via a quantum Frobenius map, we show that the Frobenius center of $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$ is isomorphic to the coordinate algebra of a Poisson homogeneous space $\\mathcal{X}$ of the dual Poisson-Lie group $G^*$. We define a filtration on $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$ such that the associated graded algebra is $q$-commutative. Using this filtration, we show that the full center of $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$ is generated by the Frobenius center and the Kolb-Letzter center, and we determine the degree of $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$. We show that irreducible representations of $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$ are parametrized by $θ$-twisted conjugacy classes. We determine the maximal dimension of those irreducible representations, and show that the dimension of an irreducible representation is maximal if the corresponding twisted conjugacy class has maximal dimension. We also study the branching problem for irreducible $\\mathrm{U}_v$-modules when restricting to $\\mathrm{U}^\\imath_v$."}

While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry."}

Let $0 \\to I \\to E \\to H \\to 0$ be a skew brace extension and $Λ_H$ denote the natural semi-direct products associated with the skew left brace $H$. We establish a group homomorphism from ${\\rm H}_{Sb}^2(H, I)$ into ${\\rm H}_{Gp}^2(Λ_H, I \\times I)$, which turns out to be an embedding when $I \\le {\\rm Soc}(E)$. In particular the Schur multiplier of a skew left braces $H$ embeds into the Schur multiplier of the group $Λ_H$. Analog of the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem is established for skew left braces in several specific cases. We introduce a concept called minimal extensions (which stay at the extreme end of split extensions) of skew left braces and derive many fundamental results. Several reduction results for split extensions of finite skew left braces by abelian groups (viewed as trivial left braces) are obtained."}
