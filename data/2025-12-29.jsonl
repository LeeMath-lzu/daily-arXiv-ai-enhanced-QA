The $R$-operator is the one obtained by Sun, Terashima, Yagi, and the authors in 2024, involving four quantum dilogarithms with arguments in the $q$-Weyl algebra. The new $K$-operator similarly involves ten such quantum dilogarithms. Our approach is based on the quantum cluster algebra associated with the symmetric butterfly quiver on the wiring diagram of type C."}

In the case $M=\\pm 1$, algebra $\\mathcal{A}_{\\pm1,N}$ is a shifted quantum toroidal $\\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra introduced in [FJM2]. Conjecturally there is a coproduct homomorphism $\\mathcal{A}_{M,N_1+N_2}\\to\\mathcal{A}_{M,N_1}\\hat\\otimes\\mathcal{A}_{M,N_2}$ to a completed tensor product, whose restriction to the subalgebras $\\mathcal{E}_1,\\check{\\mathcal{E}}_1$ coincides with the standard coproduct of the latter. We give examples of $\\mathcal{A}_{M,N}$ modules constructed on certain direct sums of tensor products of Fock modules of $\\mathcal{E}_1\\otimes\\check{\\mathcal{E}}_1$."}

Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities."}

They arise from Drinfeld-Jimbo quantization, at unimodular deformation parameter, of the totally positive part of higher rank split real Lie groups in type $A$. Our techniques are based on quantum cluster theory, in particular as developed through the work of Fock and Goncharov."}
