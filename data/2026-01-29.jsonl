It is proved that the Gorenstein global dimension of $H$ coincides with the Gorenstein projective dimension of the trivial left (or right) $H$-module $k$. Then, $H$ is finite dimensional if and only if the Gorenstein projective dimension of $k$ is trivial. Although monoidal Morita-Takeuchi equivalence of Hopf algebras does not preserve the global dimension, we demonstrate that it does preserve the Gorenstein global dimension and the Artin-Schelter Gorenstein property; this supports Brown-Goodearl's question of whether every noetherian (affine) Hopf algebra is AS Gorenstein. Finally, for $H$ and an $H$-Galois object $B$, we show the categories of modules $_H\\mathcal{M}$ and $_B\\mathcal{M}_B^H$ are monoidal model categories regarding Gorenstein projective model structure, provided that the Gorenstein global dimension of $H$ is finite. The corresponding stable categories are tensor triangulated categories."}

We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\\mathscr C_ξ$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$."}

In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry."}

For reasons that will become clear, we call this quotient the mixed doubles category, $MD$. Then our main result is a theorem classifying all mixed doubles representations in rank-2.\n  Each representation yields a mixed doubles group representation for every loop braid group $LB_n$, and we are able to analyse the unified linear representation theory of many of these sequences of representations, using a mixture of very classical, classical, and new techniques. In particular this is a motivating example for the `glue' generalisation of charge-conserving representation theory (a form of rigid higher non-semisimplicity) introduced recently."}

This allows us to prove that the crystallized algebra $C(K_{0})$ is a compact quantum semigroup for the above mentioned cases, thus extending an earlier result for type $A_{n}$ compact quantum groups.

We obtain modified notions of skein algebras of surfaces and skein modules of 3-cobordisms for non-semisimple ribbon categories.\n  We prove that these skein categories built from ideals coincide with factorization homology, shedding new light on the similarities and differences between the semisimple and non-semisimple settings. The essential difference is the need to work with profunctors in the non-semisimple setting. Doing so produces a ``distinguished presheaf'' which plays the role of the distinguished object in skein categories in semisimple settings. As a consequence, we get a skein-theoretic description of factorization homology for a large class of balanced braided presentable categories, precisely all those which are expected to induce oriented categorified 3-TQFTs."}

AMS", "summary": "Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself.\n  Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\\mathsf{S}$ and $\\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants."}
