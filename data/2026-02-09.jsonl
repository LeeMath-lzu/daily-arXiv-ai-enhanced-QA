The quaternionic version of $\\mathbb{S}^7_q$ has been shown by Brain and Landi to support such a symmetry. Here we show that this is not the case for the older $\\mathbb{S}^7_q$ introduced by Vaksman and Soibelman: and as a consequence, these quantum $7$-spheres are not isomorphic."}

This result resolves a conjecture of Gorsky--Mazin--Vazirani and Wilson, establishing that the elliptic Hall algebra governs the Khovanov--Rozansky homology of torus links $T(km,kn)$. Consequently, this provides an affirmative answer to a question of Galashin and Lam in the torus link case. As a key step in the proof, we develop a rational analogue of the Shareshian--Wachs involution originally introduced to prove the symmetry property of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions."}

This method is significant for advancing the understanding of the generation, classification, and construction of (quasi-)Hopf algebras. To pave the way for the grafting method, we first set up a multi-tensor product theory for generalized double-bosonization to acquire the necessary information on the braiding $R$-matrices (see \\cite{HH2}). Beyond the perspective of braided monoidal categories arising from the representations of quantum subgroups, the grafting procedure necessitates incorporating structural information from root systems in Lie theory. This approach provides a one-stop strategy for resolving the generation problem in Majid's conjecture on quantum trees."}

The multiset of birack bracket values over the homset from a framed link's fundamental birack then forms an invariant of framed links. We then categorify this multiset to define a quiver-valued invariant of framed knots and links. From this quiver we define new polynomial invariants of framed knots and links."}

We also construct involutive non-degenerate solutions from suitable presented categories. We then investigate the case of solutions of principal homogeneous type. Finally, we present some examples of this new class of Garside groupoids."}

It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is a \"2-graph\" $Γ^2$ embedded in a 3d Cauchy slice $Σ$, which has equipped the structure of a discrete 2-groupoid. Upon such 2-graphs, we model the extended Wilson surface operators in 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's {\\it measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows these 2-graph operators -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matrix gives it a categorical quasitriangularity structure, which we call the {\\it cobraiding}. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group 2-gauge theories on the lattice. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $Γ$, and extract the observables from it."}
