Our primary motivation arises from the classification of pointed finite-dimensional coquasi-Hopf algebras. We develop a reflection theory for tuples of simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules in the category $\\GG$, where $G$ is a finite group and $Φ$ is a 3-cocycle on $G$. We prove that such a tuple gives rise to a semi-Cartan graph if admitting all reflections. Consequently, its Weyl groupoid is well-defined. We further establish several criteria for the finite-dimensionality of Nichols algebras in terms of the associated semi-Cartan graph. As an application, we provide a new proof for the infinite-dimensionality of a specific class of Nichols algebras previously studied in \\cite{huang2024classification}, bypassing extensive computational arguments."}

The motivation stems from the observation that solutions that arise from dual weak braces belong to this class. The notions of quasi rack and derived solution are introduced and examined, extending the classical definitions. Additionally, a family of quasi left non-degenerate solutions is described in terms of quasi racks and g-twists, analogous to the left non-degenerate case. Furthermore, we completely characterize a class of quasi racks expressible in terms of Plonka sum of racks."}

The group $\\mathrm{GRT}$ can be regarded as the group of automorphisms of the operad of parenthesized chord diagrams, while $\\mathrm{KRV}$ can be recovered from the automorphism group of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra of a thrice-punctured sphere. This suggests the existence of a natural way to derive Lie bialgebras from operads, and we verify this is the case. That is, we reproduce the Alekseev-Torossian injection by functorially constructing bracket and cobracket operations out of operad modules. This framework is enough to establish a relationship between Gonzalez' higher genus $\\mathrm{GRT}_g$ groups, and the higher genus $\\mathrm{KRV}_g$ groups of Alekseev, Kawazumi, Kuno, and Naef. Our construction is informed by Massuyeau and Turaev's work on Fox pairings and quasi-derivations."}

When $X=\\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\\mathrm{Conf}_Γ(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras."}

They originated in quantum topology as a framework for encoding virtual crossings. Oriented circuit algebras are equivalent to wheeled props. This paper\n  extends existing results for modular operads to construct a graphical calculus and monad for general circuit algebras and prove an abstract nerve theorem. Specialisations of these results to wheeled props follow as straightforward corollaries.\n  The machinery used to prove these results relies on a subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and provides extra insights into the underlying structures."}
