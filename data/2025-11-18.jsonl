Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205)."}

In addition, we show that the straight line does not admit an (ungraded) universal coacting Manin Hopf algebra. Moreover, we prove that for $n\\geqslant 14$ the full matrix algebra $M_n(\\mathbb k)$ admits a nontrivial Hopf algebra coaction such that all Hopf algebra actions with the same restriction on the cosupport are trivial, i.e. the cosupport may reduce under the dualization and a finite dimensional algebra may have less equivalence classes of actions than coactions. Simultaneously, for any $n\\geqslant 14$, we define an elementary grading on $M_n(\\mathbb k)$ by an infinite group that cannot be regraded by any finite group.

By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$."}

However, these models remain constrained by the Von Neumann architecture and struggle to capture the complexity of the biological brain. Quantum computing, with its foundational principles of superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution, offers a promising alternative approach to modeling neural dynamics. This paper explores the possibility of a neuro-quantum model of the brain by introducing a stochastic quantum approach that incorporates random fluctuations of neuronal processing within a quantum framework. We propose a mathematical formalization of stochastic quantum neural networks (QNNS), where qubits evolve according to stochastic differential equations inspired by biological neuronal processes. We also discuss challenges related to decoherence, qubit stability, and implications for AI and computational neuroscience."}
