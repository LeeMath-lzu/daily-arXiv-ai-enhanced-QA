We generalize the Leclerc-Miyachi formula to arbitrary levels by introducing new explicit constructions based on symbols, including a column removal theorem and closed formulas in several cases. These results provide explicit descriptions of canonical basis elements with applications to Calogero-Moser cellular characters and to the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras."}

Using classical computations of Cohen [Coh], we explicitly compute a set of generators for these operations under composition, and show that they agree with the p-fold equivariant cap products previously studied by the author [Che2] in relation to equivariant Gromov-Witten theory with mod p coefficients. The main technical novelty is a re-formulation of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operad in terms of a two-colored version of the cacti operad, and a proof that it is equivariantly quasi-equivalent to the two-colored operad of little disks on a disk/cylinder. We give applications of the main results to symplectic topology, and more specifically, arithmetic aspects of Fukaya category and classical obstructions to realizing a middle cohomology class of a symplectic manifold by Lagrangian submanifold"}

This paper establishes an analogue of this result for graded (or super) Lie algebras and, more generally, differential graded Lie algebras.\n  Closely related to this result is a calculation of the cohomology of a graded Lie algebra g with coefficients in its universal enveloping algebra U(g) as a one-sided module. This cohomology turns out to be one-dimensional and serves as a dualizing module for the cohomology of g. Moreover, it is shown that for a unimodular graded Lie algebra g, the derived category of U(g) has a Calabi-Yau structure. As a consequence, the category of rational infinity local systems on a simply connected topological space with totally finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups, has a Calabi-Yau structure, a generalization of Poincare duality for elliptic spaces."}

Quantum and stabiliser-theoretic specialisation of Algebraic Phase Theory", "summary": "We develop the quantum component of Algebraic Phase Theory by showing that quantum phase, Weyl noncommutativity, and stabiliser codes arise as unavoidable algebraic consequences of Frobenius duality. Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.\n  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.\n  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality."}

This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $π$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space."}

We first see that, given a positive real valued function on the Young graph, we may obtain a planar algebra whose structure is defined in terms of a state sum over the ways of filling planar tangles with Young diagrams. We delve into the case that the function is harmonic and related to the Plancherel measures on Young diagrams. Along with an element that is depicted as a cross of two strings, we see that the defining relations among morphisms for the Khovanov Heisenberg category are recovered in the planar algebra. We also identify certain elements in the planar algebra with particular functions of Young diagrams that include the moments, Boolean cumulants and normalized characters. This paper thereby bridges diagramatical categorification and asymptotic representation theory. In fact, the Khovanov Heisenberg category is one of the most fundamental examples of diagramatical categorification whereas the harmonic functions on the Young graph have been a central object in the asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups."}
