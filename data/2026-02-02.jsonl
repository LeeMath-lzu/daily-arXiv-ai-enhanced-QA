In particular, they showed that a subcategory is a Galois submodule if and only if its centralizer is integral. In the other direction, Schopieray has conjectured that every premodular fusion category can be embedded as a Galois-closed subcategory of a modular category; Schopieray calls such an embedding a \"Galois-modular extension.\" We prove Schopieray's conjecture for pseudounitary categories. Along the way we record some general comments about the minimal nondegenerate extension problem for braided fusion categories."}

In particular, we conclude that $\\varphi$ is injective if ${\\rm deg}(\\varphi) < p$."}

Furthermore, we study 1-cocycles of degree zero on the Lie algebra of symplectic derivations of the free Lie algebra $ \\mathfrak{L_{2n}}$, and prove the uniqueness of the Enomoto-Satoh trace."}

Specifically, we give 3 explicit rank one formulas for symmetries acting on integrable modules over a quasi-split iquantum group of arbitrary Kac-Moody type with general parameters. These symmetries are formulated in terms of idivided powers and iweights of the vectors being acted upon. We show that these symmetries are consistent with the relative braid group symmetries on iquantum groups, and they are also related to Lusztig's symmetries via quasi $K$-matrices. Furthermore, through appropriate rescaling, we obtain compatible symmetries for the integral forms of modified iquantum groups and their integrable modules. We verify that these symmetries satisfy the relative braid group relations."}

Theory. We thank the anonymous referees for their many helpful comments which greatly improved the paper", "summary": "In 2015, Lusztig [Bull. Inst. Math. Acad. Sin. (N.S.)10(2015), no.1, 1-72] showed that for a connected reductive group over an algebraic closure of a finite field the associated (geometric) Hecke category admits a truncation in a two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell, making it a categorification of the asymptotic algebra (J-ring), and that the categorical center of this \"asymptotic Hecke category\" is equivalent to the category of unipotent character sheaves supported in the cell. Subsequently, Lusztig noted that an asymptotic Hecke category can be constructed for any finite Coxeter group using Soergel bimodules. Lusztig conjectured that the centers of these categories are modular tensor categories (which was then proven by Elias and Williamson) and that for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups the S-matrices coincide with the Fourier matrices that were constructed in the 1990s by Lusztig, Malle, and Broué--Malle. If the conjecture is true, the centers may be considered as categories of \"unipotent character sheaves\" for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups.\n  In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for dihedral groups and for some (we cannot resolve all) cells of H3 and H4. The key ingredient is the method of H-reduction and the identification of the (reduced) asymptotic Hecke category with known categories whose center is already known as well. We conclude by studying the asymptotic Hecke category and its center for some infinite Coxeter groups with a finite cell."}
