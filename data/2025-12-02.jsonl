Massar"], "title": "The Poisson-Fourier Transform for bicrossed products I: Abelian approximations and the quantum duality principle", "comment": "17 pages", "summary": "The quantum duality Principle of Drinfel'd states that any quantization ${\\mathcal{G}}_{\\hbar}$ of a Poisson-Lie group $\\mathcal{G}$ should be dual as a quantum group to a quantization $\\mathcal{G}^*_{\\hbar}$ of the Poisson dual group $\\mathcal{G}^*\\!\\!$. In this paper we consider pairs $(\\mathcal{G} = G \\ltimes V, \\mathcal{G}^* = H \\ltimes W)$ with $V, W$ abelian, where we can realise the quantizations ${\\mathcal{G}}_{\\hbar}$ and $\\mathcal{G}^*_{\\hbar}$ as a bicrossed product between $G$ and $H$ in the setting of locally compact quantum groups. Assuming the existence of suitable maps $η_G : G \\to \\hat W$ and $η_H : H \\to \\hat V$ which we call abelian approximations, we implement the quantum duality principle by constructing an explicit unitary operator $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{G}} : \\mathrm{L}^2(\\mathcal{G}) \\to \\mathrm{L}^2(\\mathcal{G}^*)$, the Poisson-Fourier transform between $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{G}^*$. It induces an isomorphism of locally compact quantum group $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{G}} : \\hat{\\mathcal{G}}_{\\hbar} \\cong \\mathcal{G}^*_{\\hbar}$. After discussing the general framework for the Poisson-Fourier transform, we present several classes of examples of this phenomenon."}

In this paper, we construct closed subgroup schemes of Chevalley group schemes that parametrize symmetric subgroups of reductive groups as geometric fibers. Our construction relies crucially on the theory of quantum symmetric pairs and thus naturally admits a quantization. At the quantum level, this leads to the construction of coisotropic quantum right subgroups of the quantized function algebras of reductive groups."}

We introduce generalizations of the Pauli groups of local unitaries for quantum systems of qudits on cubic lattices and analyze stabilizer Hamiltonians whose terms are chosen from these groups. We define invertible stabilizer codes to be ground states of stabilizer Hamiltonians with trivial topological charges and completely classify them in any spatial dimension in terms of relative L-theory groups. In particular, we show that the group of equivalence classes of such codes in three spatial dimensions is isomorphic to the Witt group of abelian topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Additionally, we propose the spectrum of the relative L-theory as a representative of the generalized cohomology theory corresponding to the invertible stabilizer states."}

Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations."}

Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear partial differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general (possibly nongeneric) untwisted/unramified case with semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group, but without using parabolic/parahoric structure. The main ingredients are: (i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and (ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat."}

In disciplines where unitarity is fundamental -- such as functional analysis, quantum field theory, and quantum logic -- this language must also capture adjoints, leading to the notion of dagger categories. Higher category theory, which extends this framework to encode operations between operations, has recently become indispensable in both theoretical physics and pure mathematics. Finding a higher categorical analogue of a dagger category is therefore key to the foundations of quantum field theory.\n  In this work, we present a coherent definition of \\emph{dagger $(\\infty,n)$-category} in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism $(\\infty,n)$-category $\\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$.
