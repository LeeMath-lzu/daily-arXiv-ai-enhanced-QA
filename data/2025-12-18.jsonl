In the process, we recover invariants due to Bobtcheva-Messia, Broda-Petit, Gainutdinov-Geer-Patureau-Runkel (in collaboration with the second author), and Lee-Yetter. Our approach does not assume semisimplicity, and is based on a generalization of the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to the category of labeled Kirby graphs which also yields invariants of framed links in the boundary of $4$-dimensional $2$-handlebodies up to $2$-deformations. The setup is very flexible, and allows for several different constructions, using central elements satisfying equations introduced by Hennings and Bobtcheva-Messia, modified traces, and modules over Frobenius algebras satisfying conditions dictated by the diagrammatic calculus for embedded surfaces developed by Hughes, Kim, and Miller."}

These invariants depend additionally on a height parameter $n$, and we focus on the case $n=2$. Provided that $p>3$, we show that the height $n=2$ invariant associated to the Temperley-Lieb category at a primitive fourth root of unity vanishes on $\\mathbb{C}P^2$, $\\overline{\\mathbb{C}P}^2$, and $S^2\\times S^2$. In particular, it has the potential to detect exotic smooth structures."}

Using the cabling formula, we obtain genus bounds and a specialization to the Alexander polynomial for the colored Links--Gould polynomial that is independent of $n$, which implies corresponding properties of the $V_n$-polynomial for $n=2$ conjectured in previous work of two of the authors, and extends the work done for $n=1$. Combined with work of one of the authors arXiv:2409.03557, our genus bound for $\\mathrm{LG}^{(2)}=V_2$ is sharp for all knots with up to $16$ crossings."}

Vassiliev invariants form infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. We conjecture that such 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, we provide example of the knot family with infinite number of generators. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $k$ Vassiliev invariants."}

More precisely, $3\\mathrm{Cob}$ is the category of connected oriented $3$-dimensional cobordisms between connected surfaces with connected boundary, while $4\\mathrm{HB}$ is the category of connected oriented $4$-dimensional $2$-handlebodies up to $2$-deformations. For this purpose, we explicitly construct the inverse of the functor $Φ: 4\\mathrm{Alg} \\to 4\\mathrm{HB}$, where $4\\mathrm{Alg}$ denotes the free monoidal category generated by a Bobtcheva--Piergallini Hopf algebra. As an application, we deduce an algebraic presentation of $3\\mathrm{Cob}$ and show that it is equivalent to the one conjectured by Habiro."}
