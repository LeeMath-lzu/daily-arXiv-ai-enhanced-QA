In this note we formulate a strong version of the conjecture for Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants of closed geometric, not necessarily hyperbolic, 3-manifolds. This version in particular involves a geometrically distinguished $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ flat connection (a generalization of the standard hyperbolic flat connection to other Thurston geometries) and has a statement about the integrality of coefficients appearing in the modular transformation formula. We prove that the conjecture holds for Brieskorn homology spheres and some other examples. We also comment on how the conjecture relates to a formal realization of the $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariant at a general root of unity as a path integral in analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern--Simons theory with a rational level."}

We translate this along the Landau-Ginzburg / Conformal Field Theory correspondence to a conjecture about the unitary minimal quotients $M_d$ of the $N=2$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c_d=3-\\frac{6}{d}$: there should be a conformal embedding $M_{12}\\hookrightarrow M_{3} \\otimes M_4$ (resp. $M_{30}\\hookrightarrow M_{3} \\otimes M_5$) that exhibits the product as Ostrik's $E_6$ (resp. $E_8$) algebra in the $\\mathrm{Rep}(su(2)_{10})$ (resp. $\\mathrm{Rep}(su(2)_{28})$) factor of the NS-sector of $\\mathrm{Rep}(M_{12})$ (resp. $\\mathrm{Rep}(M_{30})$).

We first prove that when $q$ is not a root of unity, the global homological dimension of $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is exactly $3n$, while it becomes infinite when $q$ is a root of unity. We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \\rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$. We compute its Hilbert series as $(1-t)^{-3n}$, confirming polynomial growth of degree $3n$, and establish that its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension coincides with its classical Krull dimension. These results are extended to a generalized multi-parameter version $\\mathfrak{H}_n(\\mathbf{Q})$, and illustrated through detailed examples and applications in representation theory and deformation quantization."}

In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space."}

Such a situation arises when the underlying field has positive characteristic or when $H$ is infinite-dimensional. Given an $H$-module $M$ that is an extension of $V$ by $H$, we first introduce an algebra $T(V)\\#_MH$ which generalizes the usual bosonization $T(V)\\#H$. Indeed, these two objects coincide when $M$ is a trivial extension. We provide necessary conditions for $T(V)\\#_MH$ to be a Hopf algebra and a cocycle deformation of $T(V)\\#H$. These conditions appear particularly natural when $H$ is a group algebra. We then prove that every lifting is a quotient of $T(V)\\#_MH$ for some extension $M$. Echoing Archimedes, $T(V)\\#_MH$ stands as a fulcrum over which we can pivot to lift the relations of the Nichols algebra. From this point, one can replicate the strategy proposed by Andruskiewitsch, Angiono, Garcia I., Masuoka and the second author to show that every lifting is a cocycle deformation of $\\mathfrak{B}(V)\\#H$. We illustrate this idea with two examples of different nature. We classify all pointed liftings of the Fomin-Kirillov algebra $\\mathcal{FK}_3$ in characteristic $2$, and prove they are all cocycle deformations one another. We also prove that the Jordanian enveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ defined by Andruskiewitsch, Angiono and Heckenberger is a cocycle deformation of the bosonization of the Jordan plane over the infinite cyclic group."}

The motivation stems from the observation that solutions that arise from dual weak braces belong to these classes. The notions of quasi rack and derived solution are introduced and examined, extending the classical definitions. Additionally, a family of quasi left non-degenerate solutions is described in terms of quasi racks and g-twists, analogous to the left non-degenerate case. Furthermore, we completely characterize a class of quasi racks that are Plonka sum of racks."}

This confirms a conjectured description of discrete quantum groups of Kac type and brings them within the purview of category-internal universal algebra."}

Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear partial differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general (typically nongeneric) untwisted/unramified case with semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group, without using parabolic/parahoric structures on the trivial bundle. The main ingredients are: (i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and (ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat."}
