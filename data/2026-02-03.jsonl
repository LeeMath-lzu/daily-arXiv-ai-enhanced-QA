We will study these theories via their factorization algebras. The aim is to identify a minimalist formalism that makes sense of factorization algebras in any geometric context. This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories.\n  In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an \"isolability structure.\" This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are \"distant.\" This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure.\n  This paper develops this formalism. We describe how some existing theories of factorization algebras fit into this framework, and we give a construction of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian as a factorization stack that works in quite a lot of generality."}

As a main reference, I work with the book by Heckenberger and Schneider, but I want to take a distinct categorical perspective and try to develop the topic for an audience without a background in Hopf algebras. On the other hand I put some emphasis on hands-on examples. My first goal is to explain the definitions and the striking properties of Nichols algebras, foremost the odd reflection theory that is already present in Lie superalgebras. My second goal is to explain how the category of representations of a quantum group can be constructed, using categorical tools, from the Nichols algebra as its centerpiece. This makes the zoo of different existing versions of quantum groups more transparent and allows the construction of many more non-semisimple modular tensor categories. Other topics include different types of examples beyond the diagonal case, categorical versions of some Hopf algebra constructions, and an outlook section on the appearance of Nichols algebras in conformal field theory."}

This weighted count, which we call the mass, can be interpreted as the renormalized partition function of TQFT gravity. For Abelian TQFTs, the mass formula for topological boundary conditions reduces to the mass formula for particular families of codes. Focusing on the Abelian case, we show how to evaluate the mass for any bosonic theory and consider many explicit examples. We then discuss the non-Abelian generalization and compute the mass for $n + \\bar n$ copies of the Ising modular tensor category. Finally, we generalize the construction to five dimensions and compute the mass for Abelian 2-form Chern-Simons theories."}

In this paper, we study the optimization of maximal quantum $f$-divergences along unitary orbits of two quantum states.\n  For any operator convex function $f:(0,+\\infty)\\to\\mathbb{R}$, we determine the exact minimum and maximum of $$ U \\longmapsto \\widehat S_f(ρ\\|U^*σU) $$ over the unitary group, and derive explicit spectral formulas for these extremal values together with complete characterizations of the unitaries that attain them.\n  Our approach combines the integral representation of operator convex functions with majorization theory and a unitary-orbit variational method. A key step is to show that any extremizer must commute with the reference state, which reduces the noncommutative optimization problem to a spectral permutation problem. As a consequence, the minimum is achieved by pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ and $σ$, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ with the increasing eigenvalues of $σ$. Hence, the range of the maximal quantum $f$-divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval determined by these two extremal configurations.\n  Finally, we compare our results with recent unitary-orbit optimization results for quantum $f$-divergences defined via the quantum hockey-stick divergence, highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two frameworks. Our findings extend earlier extremal results for Umegaki, Rényi, and related quantum divergences, and clarify the distinct operator-theoretic nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences."}

For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\\mathbb{R}) \\times$ SL$(2,\\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy."}
