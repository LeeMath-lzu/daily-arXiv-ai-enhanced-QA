For a $V$-module $W = \\oplus W_d$, a sequence of associative algebras $\\mathfrak{A}_d$ acts on each graded component $W_d$. When these $d$th-mode transition algebras $\\mathfrak{A}_d$ are strongly unital - meaning they are unital with units acting as the identity on $W_d$ - the associated sheaves of conformal blocks are vector bundles rather than merely coherent sheaves. This strong unital property, while difficult to verify in practice, has other important implications as well. Here we construct explicit strong units for $L_{\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}_2}}(1,0)$, the simple affine VOA for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at level $1$, and establish that mode transition algebras for universal affine VOAs for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are never strongly unital at any level $k$ not equal to the critical level $-2$."}

We prove that the symplectic blob algebras are graded cellular and provide a conjectural algorithm for calculating their graded decomposition matrices. In doing so, we give the first explicit family of finite-dimensional graded quotients of the orientifold quiver Hecke algebras, providing a new entry point for the structure of these algebras -- in the spirit of Libedinsky--Plaza's ``blob algebra approach'' to modular representation theory."}

Under this equivalence, we find that the word length filtration of quantum shuffle algebras as defined in Ellenberg-Tran-Westerland corresponds to the codimension filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves. Furthermore, we find that the geometric weight filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves corresponds to a filtration on quantum shuffle algebras which has not been previously defined in the literature, and we call this the algebraic weight filtration. To apply this to Hurwitz spaces, we prove a comparison theorem between the weight filtrations for Hurwitz spaces over $\\mathbb F_p$ and $\\mathbb C$, generalizing the comparison theorem of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland. This allows us to determine the cohomological weights for Hurwitz spaces explicitly using the algebraic weight filtration of the corresponding quantum shuffle algebra. As a consequence, we find that most weights of Hurwitz spaces are smaller than expected from cohomological degree, and we prove explicit nontrivial upper bounds for weights in some cases, such as when $G=S_3$ and $c$ is the conjugacy class of transpositions."}

The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series."}

We study the structural properties of these solutions with a particular focus on their left derived shelves, which belong to the class of conjugation racks. Consistently, we show that these solutions belong to a broader class that includes skew brace solutions. In particular, we prove that each such solution can be decomposed as a hemi-semidirect product of a skew brace solution endowed with a certain compatible action on the idempotents of the associated di-skew brace structure. Finally, we provide concrete instances of these solutions through a suitable notion of averaging operators on groups."}
