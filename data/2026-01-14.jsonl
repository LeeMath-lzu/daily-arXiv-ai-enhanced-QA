The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fréchet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.\n  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.\n  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction."}

These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \\subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\\mathrm{Rep}((\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry."}

In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \\[ \\min_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\max_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU), \\] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ and $σ$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ with the increasing spectrum of $σ$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, Rényi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences."}

Typos are corrected and references are added (v2)", "summary": "We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities."}
