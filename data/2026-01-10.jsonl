Reshetikhin defines an invariant $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^ψ(K, ρ, μ)$ of a knot $K$, a representation $ρ: π_{1}(S^{3} \\setminus K) \\to \\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$, and a logarithm $μ$ of a meridian eigenvalue of $ρ$. It can be interpreted as a geometric twist of the Kasahev invariant or as a quantization of the $\\operatorname{SL}(\\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons invariant and is defined using a discrete state-sum involving quantum dilogarithms. In this paper we show how to express $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^ψ(K, ρ, μ)$ as a sum over contour integrals in a space parametrizing hyperbolic structures on the knot complement. Such integral presentations are an important step in determining the asymptotics of quantum invariants as predicted by the Volume Conjecture. We discuss this perspective and the remaining obstacles to establishing exponential growth of $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^ψ$."}

The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series."}
