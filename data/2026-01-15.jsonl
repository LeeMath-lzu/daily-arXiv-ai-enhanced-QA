For a braided fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ over $\\mathcal{E}$ we give sufficient and necessary conditions that characterize the Witt relation $[\\mathcal{C}]=[\\mathcal{E}]$. Then we show the Witt group $\\mathcal{W}(\\mathcal{E})$ is naturally a direct sum of Witt group $\\mathcal{W}:=\\mathcal{W}(\\text{Vec})$ and the group $\\text{H}^4(G,\\mathbb{K}^\\times)$. Consequently, for any non-degenerate fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ over $\\mathcal{E}$, there is a positive integer $n$ (e.g. $n=|G|$) such that $\\mathcal{C}^{\\boxtimes_\\mathcal{E}^n}$ admits a minimal extension."}

Using this presentation, we prove that its jellyfish algorithm is a well-defined surjection onto $\\mathbb{C}$. In particular, this shows that the jellyfish algorithm is an invariant on closed diagrams for this planar algebra."}

Major updates are: corrected the use of Deligne tensor product of supercategories; added assumption 6 in Section 6.1; added Proposition 6.17. We thank the anonymous referees for very helpful comments!", "summary": "We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.\n  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan Hölder length.\n  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators."}

Corrected an error related to the associator of $\\mathcal{A}$. We thank the anonymous referees for very helpful comments!", "summary": "We analyze the non-semisimple category of line operators in Chern-Simons gauge theories based off the Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Our proposal is that the category of line operators $\\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with the derived category of modules for a boundary vertex operator algebra $\\mathcal{V}$ realized as a certain infinite-order simple current extension of the affine current algebra $V(\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ by boundary monopole operators. By translating this simple current extension of $V(\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ to the unrolled, restricted quantum group $\\overline{U}^E(\\fgl(1|1))$, we show that our category of line operators admits a second description in terms of a quasi-quantum group $\\mathcal{A}$ realized by uprolling. We also compare our results across an expected physical duality with the cyclic orbifold of a free, $B$-twisted hypermultiplet and find a slight discrepancy at the level of braiding and associator. We end with a detailed analysis of coupling to background flat $GL(1, \\C)$ connections and the resulting category of non-genuine line operators."}
