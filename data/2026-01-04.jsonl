The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series."}

The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules.\n  This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras.\n  The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework."}

A holomorphic conformal field theory with a Kac-Moody subalgebra implies a topological interface between Chern-Simons gauge theories. Upon condensing a suitable set of anyons, such an interface yields a duality between topological field theories. We illustrate this idea using the $c=24$ holomorphic theories classified by Schellekens, which leads to a list of novel sporadic dualities. Some of these dualities necessarily involve condensation of anyons with non-abelian statistics, i.e. gauging non-invertible one-form global symmetries. Several of the examples we discover generalize from $c=24$ to an infinite series. This includes the fact that Spin$(n^{2})_{2}$ is dual to a twisted dihedral group gauge theory. Finally, if $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $k$, we deduce the existence of a sequence of holomorphic CFTs at central charge $c=2(k-1)$ with fusion category symmetry given by $\\mathrm{Spin}(k)_{2}$ or equivalently, the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariantization of a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category."}

This yields (short) quantization of the Coulomb branch and correlators of the Coulomb branch operators captured by the 1d topological sector. This is done by extending the hemisphere partition function approach to noncotangent matter. In this setting one must first cancel the parity anomaly, and overcome an obstacle that $(2,2)$ boundary conditions for half-hypers are generically incompatible with gauge symmetry. Using the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge fields and a careful treatment of half-hypermultiplet boundary data, we describe the resulting shift/difference operators implementing monopole insertions (including bubbling effects) on $HS^3$, and use the $HS^3$ partition function as a natural module on which the Coulomb-branch operator algebra $\\mathcal{A}_C$ is represented. As applications we derive generators and relations of $\\mathcal{A}_C$ for $SU(2)$ theories with general matter (including half-integer spin representations), analyze theories with Coulomb branch $y^2=z(x^2-1)$, compute the Coulomb branch of an $A_n$ quiver with spin-$\\frac32$ half-hypers, and check consistency of a general monopole-antimonopole two-point function."}

Degenerate conformal blocks can be described by the same integrals with special choice of parameters. Integrals satisfy various recurrent relations, which for the special choice of parameters reduce to closed equations. This setting is widely used in explaining the AGT relation, because similar integral representations exist also for Nekrasov functions. We extend this approach to the case of q-Virasoro conformal blocks on elliptic surface -- generic and degenerate. For the generic case, we check equivalence with instanton partition function of a 5d circular quiver gauge theory. For the degenerate case, we check equivalence with partition function of a defect in the same theory, also known as the Shiraishi function. We find agreement in both cases. This opens a way to re-derive the sophisticated equation for the Shiraishi function as the equation for the corresponding integral, what seems straightforward, but remains technically involved and is left for the future."}
