This paper can be seen as an addendum to our earlier work. It contains little new mathematical content, but is intended to give an overview of a different viewpoint on the Johnson homomorphism, for experts working mainly in the latter area."}

We then define correspondingly higher order generalizations of Clifford and meson algebras."}

Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $\\mathrm{PSL}_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\\operatorname{Rep}\\mathrm{PSL}_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\\operatorname{Rep}\\mathrm{PSL}_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory."}

Final version accepted for publication in Letters in Mathematical Physics", "summary": "This paper develops a graphical calculus to determine the $n$-shifted Poisson structures on finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebras. When applied to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of an ordinary Lie algebra, we recover Safronov's result that the $(n=1)$- and $(n=2)$-shifted Poisson structures in this case are given by quasi-Lie bialgebra structures and, respectively, invariant symmetric tensors. We generalize these results to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $2$-algebra and obtain $n\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ shifted Poisson structures in this case, which we interpret as semi-classical data of `higher quantum groups'."}

In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories."}

Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in \"non-semisimple\" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\\in\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. We finally discuss implications of our results on the K-operators for quantum integrable systems."}
