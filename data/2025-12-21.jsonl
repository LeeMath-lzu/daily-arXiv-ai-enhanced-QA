By considering quivers with quantum group like relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, we follow RTT construction to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers."}

We show that any abstract A$_\\infty$ deformation is \"geometric\", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases.\n  We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped.\n  Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points."}

By considering noncommutative entry functions on matrix structures, Woronowicz introduced corepresentations of compact quantum groups, namely Woronowicz's $C^*$-algebras (also known as compact matrix pseudogroups). We demonstrate that every nontrivial finite sequence of random variables admits a maximal distributional symmetry determined by a Woronowicz $C^*$-algebra. This establishes a probabilistic framework for classifying compact quantum groups. Furthermore, we classify all de Finetti-type theorems for *-random variables that are invariant under distributional symmetries arising from compact matrix quantum groups in both classical and free probability settings. Our results show that only finitely many types of de Finetti theorems exist in these contexts, and the associated categories of (quantum) groups are the easy (quantum) groups introduced by Banica and Speicher."}

This study is motivated by Khovanov-Seidel's categorification of the Burau representation, from which can be extracted the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation, providing a relation between these two faithful representations of the braid groups."}

We verify the conjecture under a multiplicative reachability condition, answering the Hernandez--Leclerc classification problem in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras under this condition. Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules."}

Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct a functor assigning a canonical Leibniz algebra to every affine algebraic rack. This functor recovers the Lie algebras of affine algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks, and it is compatible with closed subracks and left ideals. We also compare properties of affine algebraic racks, commutative corack algebras, and their Leibniz algebras."}

We also propose a Frenkel-Mukhin-type algorithm for $q$-characters of finite-dimensional simple modules with integral highest $\\ell$-weights."}

Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra."}

This gives the first analysis-free proof of the existence of exotic compact orientable $4$-manifolds. We also present a family of exotic knot traces that seem not directly recoverable from gauge/Floer-theoretic methods. Along the way, we present new explicit calculations of the Khovanov skein lasagna modules, and we define lasagna generalizations of the Lee homology and Rasmussen $s$-invariant, which are of independent interest. Other consequences of our work include a slice obstruction of knots in $4$-manifolds with nonvanishing skein lasagna module, a sharp shake genus bound for some knots from the lasagna $s$-invariant, and a construction of induced maps on Khovanov homology for cobordisms in $k\\mathbb{CP}^2$."}
