We prove from our definition that the off-shell Bethe vectors indeed become on-shell when the Bethe equations are obeyed.\n  Then, we show that some properties for these off-shell Bethe vectors, such as the action formulas of monodromy entries on these vectors, their rectangular recurrence relations and their coproduct formula, are a consequence of our definition."}

This result is new in type $\\mathrm{C}$. We also prove that the folding homomorphism, introduced by Hernandez, gives a dimension-preserving bijective correspondence between the finite-dimensional simple representations of untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical simply-laced type and those of the corresponding doubly-twisted quantum loop algebras. This result is new in type $\\mathrm{D}$. In our approach, we develop a bootstrapping method for $q$ and $(q,t)$-characters, based on the freezing operator previously introduced in the context of cluster algebras by the second named author. This method allows us to reduce statements for general simple representations in all classical types to corresponding results on core subcategories in a uniform manner."}

A central challenge is to formulate topological order on the lattice and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general spacetime dimensions. We develop a lattice description of the resulting extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics.\n  Our main example is the $(4+1)$D \\emph{fermionic-loop toric code}, obtained by condensing the $e^2 m^2$-loop in the $(4+1)$D $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in $(4+1)$D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^{5}(B^{2}G, U(1))$. % Beyond $(4+1)$D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions featuring fermionic loop excitations, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. % Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial generalized statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in $(6+1)$D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the \\emph{fermionic-membrane toric code} and the \\emph{fermionic-volume toric code}."}
