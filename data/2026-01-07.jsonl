Alongside this category, we construct functors that interpolate the usual restriction functors between $\\text{GL}_{m+n}$, $\\text{P}$ and the subgroup $\\text{L}\\subseteq\\text{GL}_{m+n}$ of block-diagonal matrices, yielding a universal version of the formalism of parabolic restriction. Based on this formalism, we construct central algebras and centred bimodules which serve as algebraic ingredients for defining a skein theory on $3$-manifolds with surface and line defects. We recover the Turaev coproduct on the HOMFLY skein algebra as a particular instance of this theory. In particular, this coproduct is compatible with the cutting and gluing of surfaces."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We show a first rectification result for homotopy chain coalgebras over a field. On the one hand, we consider the $\\infty$-category obtained by localizing differential graded coalgebras over an operad with respect to quasi-isomorphisms; on the other, we give a general definition of an $\\infty$-category of coalgebras over an enriched $\\infty$-operad. We show by induction over cell attachments that these two $\\infty$-categories are in fact equivalent when the operad is cofibrant. This yields explicit point-set models for $E_n$-coalgebras and $E_\\infty$-coalgebras in the derived $\\infty$-category of chain complexes over a field, and an explicit point-set model for the cellular chains functor with its $E_\\infty$-coalgebra structure. After Bachmann--Burklund, this gives a point-set algebraic model for nilpotent $p$-adic homotopy types."}

This allows us to exhibit a new family of compact quantum groups, mixing features from quantum automorphism groups of graphs and easy quantum groups. Contrary to the classical isometry groups, whose actions on the Cuntz--Krieger algebras are never ergodic, the quantum isometry group acts ergodically in the case of the Cuntz algebra. This also leads to the construction of a (genuinely quantum) ergodic and faithful action of a compact matrix quantum group on the Cantor space."}

Sharapov"], "title": "Quantization of bounded symplectic domains associated with compact Lie groups", "comment": "40 pages, 2 figures, v2 - journal version", "summary": "We present a systematic quantization scheme for bounded symplectic domains of the form $D \\times G \\subset T^\\ast G$, where $D \\subset \\mathfrak{g}^\\ast$ is a bounded region defined by algebraic inequalities and $G$ is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The finiteness of the symplectic volume implies that quantization yields a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with observables represented by Hermitian matrices, for which we provide an explicit realization. Boundary effects necessitate modifications of the standard von Neumann and Dirac conditions, which usually underlie the correspondence principle. Physically, the compact group $G$ plays the role of momentum space, while $\\mathfrak{g}^\\ast$ corresponds to the (noncommutative) position space of a particle. The assumption of compact momentum space has profound physical consequences, including the supertunneling phenomenon and the emergence of a maximal fermion density."}

We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $λ$ if and only if $λ$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $λ$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases."}
