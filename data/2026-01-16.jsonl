We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $Λ$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $Λ$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \\otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms."}

When $g$ is the identity element, $\\mathfrak m_g$ is the Monster Lie algebra of Borcherds. We discuss the appearance of the $\\mathfrak m_g$ in compactified models of the Heterotic String. We also summarize recent work on associating Lie group analogs to the Lie algebras $\\mathfrak m_g$. We include a discussion of some open problems."}

Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found."}

They consist in a review of a long standing work of mine and collaborators (see references therein) in the field of non-formal deformation quantization admitting a large group of symmetries. But they also contain new material and results. More precisely, in a first part, I present a method (called the Retract Method) to define quantizations/symbolic calculi and associated operator symbol composition formulae (non-formal deformations/star products) of symplectic symmetric spaces such as the hyperbolic plane (Kahler) or symmetric co-adjoint orbits of the Poincaré group (non-metric). In a second part, I explain how to derive non-formal Drinfel'd twists for actions of non-Abelian solvable Lie groups (non-Abelian Universal Deformation Formulae) on or Fr échet algebras from the non-formal noncommutative symmetric spaces defined in the first part."}

If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\\mathcal S_1\\to\\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\\mathcal S_1\\boxtimes\\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\\mathcal S_1\\boxtimes\\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.\n  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\\to M(4,3)$."}
