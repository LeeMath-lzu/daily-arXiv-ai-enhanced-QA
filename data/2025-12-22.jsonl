For reasons that will become clear, we call this quotient the mixed doubles category, $MD$. Then our main result is a theorem classifying all mixed doubles representations in rank-2.\n  Each representation yields a mixed doubles group representation for every loop braid group $LB_n$, and we are able to analyse the unified linear representation theory of many of these sequences of representations, using a mixture of very classical, classical, and new techniques. In particular this is a motivating example for the `glue' generalisation of charge-conserving representation theory (a form of rigid higher non-semisimplicity) introduced recently."}

Using a conjectural asymptotic behavior of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients we identify the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with algebras of quantized functions on homogeneous spaces of $G$. We also show that the gauge-invariant part of the Toeplitz algebra provides a model for convergence of full matrix algebras to quantum flag manifolds, complementing and generalizing results of Landsman and Rieffel for $q=1$ and results of Vaes-Vergnioux in the rank one case for $q\\ne1$.\n  We verify our conjecture on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $G=SU(n)$ and all weights that are either regular or multiples of the fundamental weight $ω_1$. For $λ=ω_1$, we also provide a detailed description of the Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, generalizing results of Arveson on symmetric subproduct systems."}

In the non semisimple case related to the type B Lie algebras, the central subalgebra of Wheel Laurent polynomials is large enough to separate blocks of the BMW algebras."}

This provides an answer to a question posed by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider, who classified finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebras over finite abelian groups whose order is coprime with 210. As application and in order to give not-too-technical examples, we recover with our method the liftings of type $A_{n}$ computed by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider, of type $B_2$ computed by Beattie, Dascalescu and Raianu, and of type $B_3$ computed by the authors, for Drinfeld-Jimbo type braidings. Moreover, we present all liftings of type $B_θ$ and $D_θ$, for $θ\\geq 2$, giving in this way new explicit infinite families of liftings for Drinfeld-Jimbo type braidings."}

A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure."}

In this paper we construct representations of $\\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{\\mathrm{inv}}(H)$ on cohomology spaces $\\mathrm{Ext}_H^m(X,M)$ for all $m \\geq 0$, where $X$ is any $H$-module and $M$ is any $\\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$-module endowed with a compatible $H$-module structure. As a corollary and under suitable assumptions on $H$, we obtain projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces on such Ext spaces. This recovers the projective representations constructed by Lentner-Mierach-Schweigert-Sommerhäuser from Lyubashenko theory, when the category $\\mathcal{C} = H\\text{-}\\mathrm{mod}$ is used in their construction. Other topological applications are matrix-valued invariants of knots in thickened surfaces and representations of skein algebras on Ext spaces."}

Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility generalizes the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure."}
