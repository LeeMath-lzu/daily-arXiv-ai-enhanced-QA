Our $\\mathrm{E}\\mathbb{F}$ is a direct sum of invertible $\\mathbb{F}$-modules, indexed by a $μ_6$-extension of the Witt group $W$ of non-degenerate braided fusion categories. Similarly, we enhance the 3-category $S\\mathbb{F}$ of fusion super-categories to a symmetric tensor 3-category $\\mathrm{E} S\\mathbb{F}$ with full duals, which is a sum of invertible $S\\mathbb{F}$-modules, indexed by an extension of the super-Witt group $SW$ with kernel the Pontrjagin dual of the stable stem $π_3^s$. The unit spectrum of $\\mathrm{E}S\\mathbb{F}$ is the connective cover of the Pontrjagin dual of $\\mathbb{S}^{-3}$. We discuss tangential structures and central charges of the resulting TQFTs. We establish Spin-invariance of fusion supercategories and relate SO-invariance structures to modular and spherical structures. This confirms some conjectures from arxiv:1312.7188."}

To do this we use a method of extending a tensor category by embedding the planar algebra of a $\\otimes$-generating object into the graph planar algebra of this object's fundamental graph. This allows the use of computational methods to uncover relations we would have little hope of arriving at otherwise."}

This case is of particular interest thanks to the existence of geometric realizations and Schur--Weyl dualities. We establish factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld--Cartan series $\\boldsymbolΘ_i(z)$ in the Lu--Pan--Wang--Zhang `new Drinfeld'-style presentation, generalizing the split type results from [Prz23, LP25a]. As an application, we construct a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, and show that it is compatible with Frenkel and Reshetikhin's original $q$-character homomorphism."}

Vashaw", "Sarah Witherspoon"], "title": "Noncommutative tensor triangular geometry: modules, bimodules, and unipotent Hopf algebras", "comment": "45 pages, comments welcome", "summary": "We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\\mathcal E}$ of $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \\to \\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\\mathcal K}$ of $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups."}

Accepted at Quantum", "summary": "In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and connect its perfect (bi)strategies to quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity."}
