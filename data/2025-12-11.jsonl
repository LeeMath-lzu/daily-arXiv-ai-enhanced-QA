In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds."}

M Rashid"], "title": "Weyl-Type and Witt-Type Algebras with Exponential Generators:Structure, Automorphisms, and Representation Theory", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper introduces and systematically studies a new class of non-commutative algebras -- Weyl-type and Witt-type algebras -- generated by differential operators with exponential and generalized power function coefficients. We define the expolynomial ring $R_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}} = \\mathbb{F}\\bigl[ e^{\\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\\; e^{\\mathcal{A} x},\\; x^{\\mathcal{A}} \\bigr]$ associated to an additive subgroup $\\mathcal{A} \\subset \\mathbb{F}$, and investigate its Ore extension $A_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}} = R_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}}[\\partial; δ]$ (Weyl-type) and its derivation algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}} = \\operatorname{Der}_{\\mathbb{F}}(R_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}})$ (Witt-type). Our main results establish: (1) the automorphism group of $R_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}}$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}^{\\times})^{2r+1} \\rtimes \\operatorname{GL}(2r+1,\\mathbb{Z})$; (2) a Galois descent theorem showing that fixed-point subalgebras under finite Galois actions recover the original Weyl-type algebra; (3) the non-existence of finite-dimensional simple modules for $A_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}}$; (4) the Zariski density of isomorphism classes in moduli spaces as transcendental parameters vary; (5) the stability of simplicity under generic quantum deformation; and (6) a complete representation-theoretic framework including the classification of irreducible weight modules, the construction of Harish--Chandra modules with BGG-type resolutions, and the structure of category $\\mathcal{O}$. These results unify and extend classical theories of Weyl algebras, Witt algebras, and generalized Weyl algebras, while opening new directions in deformation theory, non-commutative geometry, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras."}

In the uniparametric setting, we start from quantised universal enveloping superalgebras over gl(n) - endowed with a super-structure - as in [Ya1] and [Zha]: through a direct approach, we construct their linear dual, thus finding the quantum formal series Hopf superalgebras mentioned above, which are described in detail via an explicit presentation. Starting from the latter, then, we perform a deformation by a well-chosen 2-cocycle, thus getting a multiparametric quantisation, described again by an explicit presentation: this is, in turn, the dual to the multiparametric quantised universal enveloping algebra over gl(n) from [GGP]. We also provide some \"polynomial versions\" of these quantisations, both for the uniparametric and the multiparametric case. In particular, we compare the latter to Manin's quantum function algebras from [Ma]. Finally, both for the uniparametric and the multiparametric setting, we provide suitable PBW-like theorems, in \"formal\" and in \"polynomial\" versions alike."}

Goertz", "Paul Wedrich"], "title": "A note on TQFTs for orientable 2-dimensional cobordisms", "comment": "5 pages, comments welcome. v2: references updated", "summary": "Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) are symmetric monoidal functors out of cobordism categories. In dimension two, oriented TQFTs are famously classified by commutative Frobenius algebras. In the unoriented setting, the classification requires additional data: an involution and a value assigned to the Möbius strip. In this work, we describe an intermediate framework that classifies 2-dimensional TQFTs for orientable cobordisms, in an appropriate sense. Our motivation arises from skein-theoretic models of surfaces embedded in 3-manifolds and Khovanov homology, where surfaces are often treated as unoriented, even though the associated 2-dimensional TQFTs themselves need not be fully unoriented."}
