As an application, we develop a categorical framework for a presentation of the skein lasagna module of trisected closed 4-manifolds. Further, we extend the theory to dimension two by introducing bicategories for closed oriented surfaces and proving a gluing formula for the categories associated with 3-manifolds with boundary."}

In the uniparametric setting, we start from quantised universal enveloping superalgebras over gl(n) -- endowed with a super-structure -- as in [Ya1] and [Zha]: through a direct approach, we construct their linear dual, thus finding the quantum formal series Hopf superalgebras mentioned above, which are described in detail via an explicit presentation. Starting from the latter, then, we perform a deformation by a well-chosen 2-cocycle, thus getting a multiparametric quantisation, described again by an explicit presentation: this is, in turn, the dual to the multiparametric quantised universal enveloping algebra over gl(n) from [GGP]. We also provide some \"polynomial versions\" of these quantisations, both for the uniparametric and the multiparametric case. In particular, we compare the latter to Manin's quantum function algebras from [Ma]."}

We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\\mathbb{A}=\\mathbb{Z}[q^{\\pm\\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\\mathbb{Q}(q^{\\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\\mathbb{A}'$, where $\\mathbb{A}'=\\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\\mathbb{A}'=\\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\\mathbb{A}'=\\mathbb{Q}(q^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\\mathbb{A}'=\\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\\mathbb{A}'=\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\\Bbbk$."}

This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the $s$-th level $0$ fundamental weight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J. Algebra, 2025]."}

Specifically, we construct a prefactorisation algebra on $Σ$ which locally encodes the full (non-chiral) version $\\mathbb{F}^{\\mathfrak{a},α} = \\mathbb{V}^{\\mathfrak{a},α} \\otimes \\bar{\\mathbb{V}}^{\\mathfrak{a},α}$ of a universal enveloping vertex algebra $\\mathbb{V}^{\\mathfrak a,α}$, where $\\mathfrak a$ is a finite-dimensional vector space labelling the set of fields and $α$ is a $2$-cocycle controlling the central extension of their Lie brackets. Our construction provides a unified treatment of the three canonical examples of (full) universal enveloping vertex algebras - Kac-Moody, Virasoro and $βγ$ system - using the notion of unital local Lie algebra. By using the coordinate-invariant nature of prefactorisation algebras we derive an analogue of Huang's change of variable formula for full vertex algebras. We give a careful treatment of (both Euclidean and Lorentzian) reality conditions in this formalism which allows us, in the Kac-Moody and Virasoro cases, to construct a Hermitian sesquilinear form on these full vertex algebras by using the factorisation product to the global observables on $S^2$. We also give an explicit derivation of Borcherds type identities and a construction of the operator formalism for $\\mathbb{F}^{\\mathfrak a,α}$."}
