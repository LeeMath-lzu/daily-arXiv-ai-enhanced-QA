We provide a non-technical and historical overview of the core arguments behind our proof, discuss these structural properties, and its applications to rigidity and unitarizability of braided fusion categories arising from conformal field theory. We conclude proposing some natural directions for future research."}

Please Drop 1 comment", "summary": "In this paper, we study multiple Eisenstein series, which build a natural bridge between the theory of multiple zeta values and modular forms. We prove a large family of relations among these series and propose an explicit conjectural formula for their derivatives. This formula is expressed using the double shuffle structure and the Drop1 operator introduced by Hirose, Maesaka, Seki, and Watanabe. Based on this, we propose a family of linear relations that is conjectured to generate all linear relations among multiple Eisenstein series. Motivated by this conjecture, we introduce a space of formal multiple Eisenstein series and show that it is an $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-algebra."}

This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries."}

We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras."}

We show that, in this setting, connection $1$-forms and vertical maps descend to the quotient calculus and are compatible with the induced braided symmetry. We also compare this framework with Durdevic's complete differential calculus."}

So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schrödinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies."}
