This definition is a direct analogue of the notion of super-transitivity for subfactors, and measures at what depth the first ``new stuff'' appears in the category of $A$-modules internal to $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$. Our main theorem gives a classification of all 1-super-transitive ètale algebra objects in $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ running over all $N,k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Our classification captures all known infinite families of non-pointed ètale algebras in $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$, and includes all but 16 of the known non-pointed ètale algebra objects in these categories. These remaining 16 known examples have super-transitivities between 2 and 4."}

Our main result consists in computing the characters of the spectral values of the generating matrix $L$ of ${\\cal L}(R)$ in finite-dimensional representations labeled by partitions of integers. As is known, the spectral values belong to an algebraic extension of the center of the reflection equation algebra and elements of the center can be presented as symmetric functions in spectral values. As an application of our approach, we calculate the characters of the power sums $\\mathrm{Tr}_R(L^n)$ in the mentioned finite dimensional representations.\n  In a particular case of the Drinfeld-Jimbo $R$-matrix the enveloping algebra $U(gl(N))$ can be obtained as a specific limit of the reflection equation algebra. In this limit our results for power sums coincide with the those obtained in [PP]."}

Such Borcherds algebras have no mutually orthogonal imaginary simple roots.Our group is a semi-direct product of a Kac--Moody (or semi-simple) group and a Magnus group of invertible formal power series corresponding to a basis of a certain highest weight module determined by the simple imaginary roots. We show that our group is independent of this choice of basis, up to isomorphism. We apply our construction to a number of concrete examples, such as certain Borcherds algebras formed using root lattices of hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras, the Monster Lie algebra, Monstrous Lie algebras of Fricke type and the gnome Lie algebra."}

Our formulation is sufficiently general to encompass derived algebraic, analytic and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ stacks, as well as Lagrangians and non-commutative generalisations. We also show that non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation carry unique self-dual deformation quantisations in any setting where the latter can be formulated.\n  One application is that for (not necessarily exact) $0$-shifted symplectic structures in analytic and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ settings, it follows that the author's earlier parametrisations of quantisations are in fact independent of any choice of associator, and generalise Fedosov's parametrisation of quantisations for classical manifolds.\n  Our main application is to complex $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures, showing that our unique quantisation of the canonical exact structure, a sheaf of twisted $BD_0$-algebras with derivation, gives rise to BBDJS's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, equipped with its monodromy operator."}

The main theorem of this paper constructs a Lie algebra from a vertex $F$-algebra - for the additive formal group law, this extends Borcherds' well-known construction for ordinary vertex algebras. Our construction involves the new concept of an $F$-residue and some other new algebraic concepts, which are deformations of familiar concepts for the special case of an additive formal group law."}

The decomposition (like any ideal triangulation) gives a set of gluing equations in shape parameters whose solutions are hyperbolic structures. We show that these equations can be obtained from Kashaev-Reshetikhin's braiding on the Kac-de Concini quantum group $\\mathcal{U}_ξ(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity $ξ$. This braiding gives coordinates on the $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$ representation variety of a link and our work shows how to interpret these geometrically."}
