We begin by reviewing the relation between supercharge corrections and the \"twice-generalized\" Konishi anomaly, which corrects the semi-chiral ring. In the holomorphic twist, these corrections appear as BRST anomalies and are computed using the higher operations of an underlying $L_\\infty$ conformal algebra. We then apply this formalism to obtain the complete one-loop corrections to the supercharge of four-dimensional Lagrangian supersymmetric gauge theories, including $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, where it admits a remarkably compact expression in terms of superfields."}

A (left) group code, or simply a $G$-code, is a (left) ideal of the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $\\gcd(q,n)=1$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ with $\\gcd(q,4n)=1$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach."}

In this paper, we extend the setting from rooted trees to the space $H_{\\rm RT}(X,Ω)$ of $(X,Ω)$-rooted trees, in which internal vertices are decorated by a set $Ω$ and leafs are decorated by $X \\cup Ω$. We introduce a new coalgebra structure on $H_{\\rm RT}(X,Ω)$ whose coproduct satisfies a weighted Hochschild 1-cocycle condition involving multiple operators, thereby generalizing the classical condition. A combinatorial interpretation of this coproduct is also provided. We then endow $H_{\\rm RT}(X,Ω)$ with a Hopf algebra structure. Finally, we define weighted $Ω$-cocycle Hopf algebras, characterized by a Hochschild 1-cocycle condition with weights, and show that $H_{\\rm RT}(X,Ω)$ is the free object in the category of $Ω$-cocycle Hopf algebras."}

We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\\ZZ \\subseteq \\cB \\subseteq \\cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\\Weyl{e^{\\pm x^p e^{t}},\\; e^{\\cA x},\\; x^{\\cA}} \\rtimes \\FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology."}

Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative exponential algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity."}

In particular, this shows that the cup product on the Hochschild cohomology of a triangular algebra does not generally follow the intuition coming from monomial algebras. Our examples also demonstrate that the Hochschild cohomology of a deformation of an algebra may not experience the dimension drop but still have a different cup product structure, and that the Hochschild cohomologies of deformations of two derived equivalent algebras may exhibit noticeably different behaviours."}

Title revised.

We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code."}
