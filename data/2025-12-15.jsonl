Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{F}_q),\\mathrm{U}(1))$."}

There is a natural Poisson algebra structure on the tensor product of a pre-Poisson algebra and a perm algebra, and the Poisson algebra structure on the tensor product of a pre-Poisson algebra and a special perm algebra characterizes the pre-Poisson algebra. We extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a Poisson bialgebra structure on the tensor product of a pre-Poisson bialgebra and a quadratic $\\bz$-graded perm algebra.In this process, we provide the affinization of Zinbiel bialgebras, and give a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in pre-Poisson algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in the induced infinite-dimensional Poisson algebras. The similar correspondences for the related triangular bialgebra structures and $\\mathcal{O}$-operators are given."}

We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\\ZZ \\subseteq \\cB \\subseteq \\cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\\Weyl{e^{\\pm x^p e^{t}},\\; e^{\\cA x},\\; x^{\\cA}} \\rtimes \\FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology."}

The proof is based on Massuyeau's work in genus 0. The framing is automatically determined from the choice of a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator, and in the case of genus 1, we show that only one particular framing is realised by our construction."}

This allows us to prove that the crystallized algebra $C(K_{0})$ is a compact quantum semigroup, thus extending an earlier result for type $A_{n}$ compact quantum groups. We also prove that the notions of crystallized quantized function algebra given by Matassa & Yuncken coincide with that of Giri & Pal in the type $A_{n}$ case."}
