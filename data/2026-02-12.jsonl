The main input datum is a closed foam evaluation formula. As examples, we rigorously construct semistrict monoidal 2-categories based on gl(N)-foams, which underlie the general linear link homology theories, and further examples based on Bar-Natan's decorated cobordisms, related to Khovanov homology. These monoidal 2-categories are typically non-semisimple, have duals for all objects, adjoints for all 1-morphisms, and carry a canonical spatial duality structure expressing oriented 3-dimensional pivotality and sphericality."}

Therefore, we can quantize any Lie algebra action by symplectic vector fields."}

A factorizable dual pre-Poisson bialgebra induces a factorization of the underlying dual pre-Poisson algebra, and the double of any dual pre-Poisson bialgebra is factorizable. We introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter dual pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable dual pre-Poisson bialgebras and quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebras of nonzero weights. Moreover, a method of constructing infinite-dimensional dual pre-Poisson bialgebras using finite-dimensional Poisson bialgebras is given. We prove that there is a completed dual pre-Poisson bialgebra structure the tensor product of a Poisson bialgebra and a quadratic $\\bz$-graded perm algebra, and this completed dual pre-Poisson bialgebra structure is coboundary (resp. quasi-triangular, triangular) if the original Poisson bialgebra is coboundary (resp. quasi-triangular, triangular). The induced factorizable finite-dimensional dual pre-Poisson bialgebras are considered."}

Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them."}

We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction."}

VI to show the equivalence between QCAs constructed from TQFT and ISA. Expanded discussions throughout", "summary": "We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l{+}1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l{-}2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l{+}1)$ dimensions and $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l{-}1)$ dimensions. We further prove that the QCAs in $3$ spatial dimensions constructed via TQFTs and ISAs are equivalent by identifying their boundary algebras, and show that this approach extends to higher dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories."}

The Verma modules are realised on polynomial spaces and, interestingly, we find along the way the need to work with non-commuting variables.
