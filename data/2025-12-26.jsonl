We define the corresponding Hochschild complex controlling deformations and prove formality theorems for the Fréchet algebras of smooth functions on a manifold, the de Rham algebra and for the Dolbeault algebra of a complex manifold. In the latter case, the Hochschild cohomology is equivalent to Kontsevich's extended deformation complex, the Hochschild cohomology of the derived category in case $X$ is a smooth projective variety and to Gualtieri's deformation complex of $X$ viewed as generalized complex manifold. We also compute the continuous Hochschild cohomology for various categories of matrix factorisations."}

Flood", "Gabriele Lobbia", "Giacomo Tendas"], "title": "Canonical differential calculi via functorial geometrization", "comment": "51 pages", "summary": "Given a category $\\mathcal{E}$, we establish sufficient conditions on a faithful isofibration $\\mathcal{E}\\rightarrow\\operatorname{Mon}(\\mathcal{V})$ valued in the category of monoids internal to a monoidal additive category $\\mathcal{V}$ such that $\\mathcal{E}$ admits a canonical functor to the category of first order differential calculi in $\\mathcal{V}$. Generalizing the procedure of extending a first order differential calculus to its maximal prolongation to this setting, we obtain a canonical functor from $\\mathcal{E}$ to the category of differential calculi in $\\mathcal{V}$. This yields a simultaneous generalization of the de Rham complex on $C^{\\infty}$-rings, the Kähler differentials on commutative algebras, and the universal differential calculus on associative algebras. As a consequence, such categories $\\mathcal{E}$ admit natural analogues of the notions of smooth map and diffeomorphism, as well as a functorial de Rham theory. Moreover, whenever two such faithful isofibrations to $\\operatorname{Mon}(\\mathcal{V})$ factor suitably, their corresponding de Rham functors are related via a comparison map. Developing this theory requires first extending the noncommutative geometry formalism of differential calculi from associative algebras to the setting of monoids internal to monoidal additive categories."}

This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \\times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations."}

In this paper, we show that ${}^\\imath Y_μ$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\\imath W_μ$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and supply strong evidence toward the expectation that ${}^\\imath Y_μ^λ$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\\imath\\overline{W}_μ^λ$. We identify the islices ${}^\\imath\\overline{W}_μ^λ$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirković-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to relate closely to the islices ${}^\\imath\\overline{W}_μ^λ$ and the algebras ${}^\\imath Y_μ^λ$."}
