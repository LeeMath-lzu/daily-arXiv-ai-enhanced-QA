Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\\text{UV}+h_c^\\text{IR}\\in\\frac12\\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition."}

In particular, we give the order of the Dehn twists under the mapping class group representations of closed surfaces. For Dehn twists about non-separating simple closed curves, we prove that this order is the order of the ribbon twist, thereby generalizing a result that De Renzi-Gainutdinov-Geer-Patureau-Mirand-Runkel obtained for the small quantum group. In the separating case, we express the order using the order of the ribbon twist on monoidal powers of the canonical end. As an application, we prove that the Johnson kernels of the mapping class groups act trivially if and only if for the canonical end the ribbon twist and double braiding with itself are trivial. We give a similar result for the visibility of the Torelli groups."}
